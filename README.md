# liri-node-app

Screen shot is in gitHub repository. I attempted the first segment, the concert-this command and just could. not. get. it. to. fire. Obviously all my API calls were working because I could see there was a delay every time I ran the command in the command line but... nothing. I will re-atttempt this assigment in the coming days because I feel like I'm close. Thanks.
